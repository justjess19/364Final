 
My project allows a user to user to an airport code and recieve information about the airport. Users register an account so that their personalized data can be stored. After registering an account, the user cna enter an airport code (must be the correct code to run - there is a link of possible airport codes) and it will return the full name of the airport, the current weather (wind, visibility, and weather), current delays, and the last time it has been updated. There is also the ability to view or email your past searches and upload a profile picture.
